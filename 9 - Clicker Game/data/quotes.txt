— Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavour —
— Sit in reverie and watch the changing color of the waves that break upon the idle seashore of the mind —
— if I had a star every time you crossed my mind, I would have an entire galaxy —
— Aim for the moon; if you miss, you will land among the stars — 
— It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves —
