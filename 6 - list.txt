— Sit in reverie and watch the changing color of the waves that break upon the idle seashore of the mind —
— if I had a star every time you crossed my mind, I would have an entire galaxy —
— let our love spark and burn like a wildfire —
— Aim for the moon; if you miss, you will land among the stars — 
— you are my sun, my moon, and all my stars —
